difference between compiler and interpretor
 Compiler: 
It is a translator which takes input
A compiler is more intelligent than an assembler it checks all kinds of limits, ranges, errors, etc.
But its program run time is more and occupies a larger part of memory. It has slow speed because a compiler goes through the entire program and then translates the entire program into machine codes.
interpretor
Interpreter: 
An interpreter is a program that translates a programming language into a comprehensible language 
It translates only one statement of the program at a time.
Interpreters, more often than not are smaller than compilers.
